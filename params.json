{"name":"POMDPy","tagline":"A framework for implementing discrete or continuous POMDPs in Python. Monte-Carlo Tree Search is used as the default POMDP solver (modeled after the popular POMCP solver).","body":"This open-source project contains a framework for implementing discrete or continuous POMDPs in Python. The organization of the code was inspired by [TAPIR](http://robotics.itee.uq.edu.au/~hannakur/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=wiki:tapir) and the [POMCP](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Silver/web/Applications.html) algorithm.\r\n\r\n[What the heck is a POMDP?](http://www.pomdp.org/tutorial/index.shtml)\r\n\r\nHere's David Silver and Joel Veness's paper on POMCP, a ground-breaking POMDP solver. [Monte-Carlo Planning in Large POMDPs](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4031-monte-carlo-planning-in-large-pomdps.pdf)\r\n\r\nThis is project has been conducted strictly for research purposes. If you would like to contribute to POMDPy or if you have any comments, suggestions, or encounter any bugs (I am sure there are still quite a few as this is a work-in-progress), feel free to send me a pull request or send me an email at pemami@ufl.edu.  \r\n\r\n## Installation ##\r\nFrom the root directory of the project, run \r\n    `python setup.py install`\r\n\r\n## Running a sample ##\r\nAfter tweaking the configuration files found in the config package <optional>, run the RockSample Problem with\r\n\r\n    python src/run_pomdp.py\r\n\r\n## Dependencies ##\r\n\r\nThis project uses:\r\n\r\n* Python 2.7.9\r\n* numpy 1.9.2\r\n\r\nOptional, for extended functionality:\r\n\r\n* matplotlib 1.4.3\r\n* pytest 2.7.0\r\n* pygame 1.9.1 \r\n\r\n## TODO ##\r\n* Unit Test coverage is currently minimal, so this area is going to be expanded upon soon\r\n* The only current \"working\" test-problem is RockSample. More test problems are being worked on \r\n* An extension for GPU-MCTS is being planned. The NumbaPro Python module seems to be a good bet for this\r\n* The PyGame sim is currently not supported, due to recent changes","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
