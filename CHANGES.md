# Change Log

5/9/2015 - Started working on the ROS API 

5/8/2015 - Added a default implementation of Discrete Action Pool so users of this framework are not required to extend 
            the DiscreteActionPool class. For most discrete POMDPs, the sample default implementation of 
            DiscreteActionPool will be used.
