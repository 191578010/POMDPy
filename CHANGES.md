# Change Log

5/9/2015 - Adding the ROS API and a simplified interface for defining discrete Actions, States, and Observations

5/8/2015 - Added a default implementation of Discrete Action Pool so users of this framework are not required to extend 
            the DiscreteActionPool class. For most discrete POMDPs, the sample default implementation of 
            DiscreteActionPool will be used.
